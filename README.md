## Overview
Storm Viewer is the first project from the "100 Days of Swift" program by Paul Hudson. This project serves as an introduction to various fundamental concepts in iOS app development.

## Key Concepts
- **App Bundles**: Learn about the structure of iOS app bundles and how resources such as images are organized within them.
- **File Manager**: Explore how to interact with the file system using the `FileManager` class to access files and directories.
- **Typecasting**: Understand the concept of typecasting in Swift, including using `as?` and `as!` operators to convert between different types.
- **View Controllers**: Get hands-on experience with view controllers, the backbone of iOS app UI, to manage different screens and user interactions.
- **UIImage**: Learn about the `UIImage` class for representing and manipulating images in your app.
- **Table Views**: Discover the powerful `UITableView` for presenting structured data in a scrollable list format.
- **Image Views**: Explore the `UIImageView` class for displaying images within your app's user interface.

## Project Structure
The Storm Viewer project contains the following components:
- `ViewController.swift`: The primary view controller responsible for displaying a list of storm images.
- `FullImageViewController.swift`: A secondary view controller for displaying individual storm images in full screen.
- `No Main.storyboard`: All designing of the app's is made programmatically.
- Image assets: Contains a set of storm images used in the app.

## Getting Started
To run the Storm Viewer project, simply open it in Xcode and build it on a simulator or a physical device running iOS.
